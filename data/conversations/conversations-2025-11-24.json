Since the original driver bobtailed out before the trailer was loaded, you can change the appointment type to \"Drop\" and then register the driver as \"BOB - Loaded Drop.\" This adjustment should allow you to check in the driver properly.\n\nHowever, if you've encountered issues with making changes due to the trailer already being loaded, it might require backend support from your IT team or someone with administrative access. If that's an option for you, reaching out for assistance would be beneficial. Please keep everyone updated on any progress made!",
