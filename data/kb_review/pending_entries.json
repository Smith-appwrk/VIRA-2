    "question": "How can I check in a driver to pick up LIV1008843 when it was booked as live but already loaded on a trailer because a driver yesterday did not wait for the trailer to be loaded?",
    "answer": "You can change the appointment as Drop and then register the driver as BOB - Loaded Drop. If someone can update to drop in the background, that would allow the driver to get checked in.",
